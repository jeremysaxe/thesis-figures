 Thesis figures
All of the figures are mounted to A4 paper per the thesis requirements. We have provided a GitHub repository with the figures if closer inspection is required for digital reading. Each figure is named by the Chapter and Number in the thesis. In addition, supplementary figures for the figures in Chapter 3 are provided with the outliers included.
